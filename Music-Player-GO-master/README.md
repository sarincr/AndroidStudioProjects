# Features:

### Unifield UI, the way I'd like it to be:

- Colorful, simple and 'unified' UI : no need to navigate between activities;
- Bottom panel containing the player controls:
  - Equalizer (if present on the device);
  - Repeat 1x;
  - Skip to previous song;
  - Play/pause;
  - Skip to next song;
  - Dynamic shuffle button: randomly plays the artist or the
    device songs;
  - Settings;
- Music organized by artist;
- Top panel containing the now played song. By clicking on it You can 'reveal'/close the artist's discography;
- The now playing text is scrollable on long clicking when it is too long;
- Fast scrolling;
- Dark status bar icons for light accents;

### Settings at hand: 

- Themes (light and inverted)
- Link to git page;
- 16 UI accents!;


### Other features: 

- Pause/resume when the headsets are (dis)connected;
- Simple audio focus (notifications, calls, or other media apps) management;


### Minimal code:

*Based on nothing: it was written from scratch besides few snippets here and there*

### What does this cost?
*Music Player GO will always be free! Anyway, you can still buy me a beer, an ice cream or something via [PayPal](https://www.paypal.me/enricocid) if You really liked it! :)*

### Dependencies used: 

  - Android Support Library v4;

  - RecyclerView v7;

  - CardView v7;
